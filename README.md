# Simulation
## Study Design 1
We assign three time-stable covariates values to 5,000 patients and generate ESAS-r scores from these covariates over 12 equally spaced time periods. Patients with different covariates were assigned to exhibit three distinct trajectory patterns: 3,000 patients have constant ESAS-r low scores, 1,000 patients have increasing scores, and the remaining 1000 have decreasing ESAS-r over time. Let $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$ be a random noise and $Y_{it} \sim Exp(\lambda_t) \text{ with }\lambda_t = z_1+0.5*z_2*t-0.05*z_3*t+\epsilon$. We round $y_{it}$ to nearest integer and bound them between 0 and 10 to mimic an ESAS-r value. Constant low, increasing and decreasing groups are generated by setting $z_i = (2,0,0), (1,0,1)$, or $(0,1,0)$, respectively.

The code to generate 1,000 indepdent simulated scores for R, SAS, and Mplus can be found in file_generator.R
